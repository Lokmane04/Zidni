                RAM: RAM has a limited capacity, usually measured in GB. The average RAM capacity in personal computers generally ranges from 4 GB to 32 GB or more, depending on the needs and type of computer.
                RAM is much faster than secondary memory. 
                It is designed for quick access to data currently in use.

                temporary and are erased when the computer is turned off or restarted. She serves
                primarily to store data in use by the processor and programs
                running.<br />
                - Secondary memory: Secondary memory is non-volatile, which means that the data
                stored there remain intact even when the computer is turned off. This is the place where are
                stored long-term data, such as files and programs.

                Secondary memory has a much larger capacity than RAM, 
                ranging from 128 GB to several TB for common hard drives.

                - RAM: RAM offers very fast access to data, measured in nanoseconds (ns), which allows the processor almost instantaneous access to data.
                -Secondary memory: Secondary memory is slower than RAM in terms of data access, with access times measured in milliseconds (ms) for hard drives.
                Data stored in secondary memory needs some time to be transferred to RAM before being accessible to the processor.

                - RAM: RAM is more expensive per unit of storage than secondary memory. 
                The cost of RAM varies depending on capacity, speed, and type of RAM (DDR3, DDR4, DDR5, etc.).
                - Secondary memory: Secondary memory is generally cheaper in terms of cost per GB than RAM, making it a more economical way to store large amounts of data permanently.

                Sequential access mode is the most common for magnetic tapes. 
                Data is stored linearly on the tape, and to access a specific piece 
                of data, you need to traverse the magnetic tape from the beginning 
                (or from a specific point) sequentially until reaching the desired block. 
                This means that data access occurs in the order in which it was recorded. 
                Sequential access is generally slower because it requires traversing 
                the entire magnetic tape or a long distance to access a specific piece of data. 
                The search speed depends on the speed of the tape scrolling, recording density, and the total length of the tape.

                The format of data recorded on addressable media depends on the type of records (fixed-size, variable-size, or indefinite-size), as well as whether these records are blocked or unblocked. Below, we'll cover:
                <br />

                Each data zone contains a single logical record, 
                with the key zone reserved for the record identifier, if it has one. Typically, 
                this identifier is not repeated in the data zone.

                In this case, all records in the file have a fixed length. 
                Each block contains multiple logical records. 
                Therefore, all blocks are of the same size, except for the last one, 
                which may be shorter.If logical records have an identifier, there is:
                <br />
                -At the level of each block, the key zone will contain the largest identifier of the logical records within the block.
                <br />
                -At the level of each logical record, there is a key zone, which will contain the key of the logical record.

                In this case, the length of logical records is variable, but it is between two known bounds. 
                Each physical record contains a counter indicating the length of 
                the logical record, including the counter itself. Another counter
                indicates the length of the block, also including this counter. 
                Although this second counter has no utility in the case of unblocked records,
                it is still present.

                the largest identifier among those of the records in the block.

                  <strong>D-Recording density on a disk</strong>
                </h4>
                Recording density on a disk represents the number of bits that can be stored 
                per inch along a recording track, measured in bpi (bits per inch). 
                Generally, the density is calculated according to the following formula:
                <br />
                <h4>
                  <strong>D = Nb / L</strong>

                <br />
                - L : Length in inches.
                <br />
                The linear recording density per track is calculated as follows:
                <h4>
                  <strong>Dl = Nbp / L</strong>

                The capacity of a hard disk is the amount of data it can store. 
                It is expressed in bytes, kilobytes, and beyond (see the table below). 
                The capacity of a disk depends on its geometry and sector capacity.
